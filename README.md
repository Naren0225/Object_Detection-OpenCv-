To run your Streamlit project, follow these steps:

1.	Ensure your environment is set up:
  o	Make sure you have Streamlit installed. You can do this by running: 
  o	pip install streamlit

2.	Save your Python code:
 o	If your Streamlit project is in a file, ensure it's saved with a .py extension (e.g., app.py).
 o	If you've made any changes to the code (such as adding images or modifying logic), ensure those changes are saved.

3.	Running the app:
 o	Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory where your Python file is located.
 o	Run the following command to start the Streamlit app: 
 o	streamlit run app.py

4.	View the app:
 o	After running the command, Streamlit will automatically open your default web browser to a local address (usually http://localhost:8501).
 o	If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually visit that address.
