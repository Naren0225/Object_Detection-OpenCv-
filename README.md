# Streamlit Project Setup and Run Instructions

Follow these steps to run your Streamlit project:

### 1. Ensure your environment is set up:
- Make sure you have Streamlit installed. You can do this by running the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install streamlit
  ```

### 2. Save your Python code:
- If your Streamlit project is in a file, ensure it's saved with a `.py` extension (e.g., `app.py`).
- If you've made any changes to the code (such as adding images or modifying logic), ensure those changes are saved.

### 3. Run the app:
- Open a terminal/command prompt in the directory where your Python file is located.
- Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:
  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```

### 4. View the app:
- After running the command, Streamlit will automatically open your default web browser to a local address (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
- If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually visit that address.
